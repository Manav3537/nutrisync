Remove from the oven and let cool.\nCut the potatoes in half and scoop the flesh into a medium-sized bowl and mash until smooth. You can also use a potato ricer or food mill and rice. Let cool to room temperature.\nLine a large backing sheet with parchment paper. Add flour to the potatoes and mix.  Form a well in the middle of the mixture and add yolk, nutmeg and salt. Using a fork, stir until the potato mixture is evenly coated, it will not be completely smooth. Form the dough into a ball and divide into 4 equally-sized pieces.\nRoll each piece of dough between your hands and a lightly floured work surface into a 3/4 inch diameter rope. Cut the rope int 3/4-inch pieces and indent each piece with a fork. (The indent is optional, but will help the gnocchi hold the sauce.) Place the pieces on the parchment and repeat with the remaining dough.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil and add the gnocchi in batches. You don\'t want the water to stop boiling. It will sink to the bottom of the pot. Stirring occasionally, let the gnocchi cook until it floats and is cooked through, about 4 minutes.

I do this at first with a wooden spoon and then move on to using my hands.  Work it until it becomes a ball, then remove from your bowl  and knead it, just two or three times on a cool surface.  By this I mean just 2 or 3 kneading movements, thats all.   This dough is quite sticky and can be a little difficult.  If it is just too sticky to get into a ball, add a small amount of flour, but only a tablespoon or maximum two, you dont want to dilute the sweetness too much.  Also, the addition of more flour gives a tougher dough if you over do it.</li><li>Wrap your ball of sweet dough in cling film and chill in the fridge for at least an hour, more is better. Leave it overnight if possible.</li><li>To bake the pastry, pre-heat your oven to 180C / 350F.</li><li>Grease each of your baking cases.  The easiest way to do this is to take a piece of greaseproof paper and rub it on your stick or pat of butter, then rub it in each case, being careful to cover all the surface area with which the pastry will come into contact.  Alternatively, if you have the paper in which your butter was packaged, use this to rub around the baking area.</li><li>On a floured surface, roll out your pastry until it is about 2mm / 0.08in to 3mm / 0.10 in. thick.  Using your cutter, cut out the circles.  You can bring the pastry scraps together in a ball and keep rolling and cutting as much as you need.</li><li>Press the pastry discs carefully but firmly into their metal cases, but with enough firmness that they sit evenly.   Make sure that the pastry comes up and slightly over the top of each tartlet case. Try not to press too much as this will make the pastry too thin.</li><li>With a fork, prick all over the base of each pastry case.  Put them back into the fridge for about 15 minutes.</li><li>Then bake for about 10 to 15 minutes or until they are a very light brown colour and the pastry is no longer soft.  Remove from the oven, cool and then remove from the tartlet cases.</li><li>For the  Crme Ptissire</li><li>To start the crme ptissire take an electric whisk and beat the egg yolks in a bowl with about a third of the sugar until the mix becomes pale yellow.</li><li>Add the flour and whisk until everything is incorporated evenly, no lumps, and the it has thickened a little.</li><li>Heat the milk in a pan (not a non-stick pan) with the rest of the sugar and the vanilla.  Just as it comes to the boil, remove your pan from the heat and pour about two thirds of the hot milk into your bowl containing the egg and sugar mix.  Stir quickly with a metal hand whisk for a minute then add the rest of the milk and continue stirring quite firmly until everything is smooth and evenly incorporated.</li><li>Put the pan back on a medium heat and pour your crme ptissire into the pan.  Stir continuously with your metal whisk.  As it thickens you may have to stir quite vigorously.  Let it bubble gently for 2 minutes and then remove from the heat.</li><li>Sprinkle over a very thin layer of icing sugar and allow your crme ptissire to cool.  The layer of icing sugar prevents the formation of a skin.</li><li>For the Strawberry Filling</li><li>Place the chopped strawberries, toasted almonds and icing sugar in a bowl and mix together.</li><li>Assembly</li><li>Once the pastry cases and the crme patissiere has cooled, take the case, put about a table spoon of the crme patisiere in the bottom and spread out evenly.  You can do this by putting the crme patissiere in a piping bag, but I just spread it with a knife.  Then spoon over some of the strawberry filling and top with a quartered strawberry.  You can also give the tartlets a dusting of icing sugar if you wish.</li><li>Tips and Variations</li><li>These little tartlets are best eaten fresh.  The longer you leave them, you run the risk of the pastry being softened by the filling.</li><li>Serve with a bit of crme fraiche or mascarpone on the side for some extra indulgence.</li><li>If you have pastry left over, you can freeze it until you wish to use.</li><li>There are quite a lot of parts to this recipe.  I find the best way to organize myself is to make the pastry the day before, then just leave it in the fridge overnight. I then start by rolling it and placing it in the tartlet cases, then it goes back into the fridge.  Whilst the pastry is chilling, I get the oven on.  When the tartlets are baking, I make the crme patissiere.  While the pastry and crme patissiere are cooling I make the strawberry and almond filling and the decorations.</li></ol>','https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/659613-312x231.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2025-04-28 13:18:03'),(184,'659135','Salmon with roasted vegetables','Season the salmon fillets with some salt, pepper and a pinch of paprika and keep aside.\nPreheat the oven to 200 C.

I like to use the paper that the butter is wrapped in to wipe around the pan.  Or you can use some greaseproof paper to do this.  Put your pan on a medium high heat and wait for it to get hot.</li><li>Taking a ladle (about 75ml  / 2.5 fl. oz.) full of the batter, pour it into the middle of your pan and swirl it around and using  the back of the ladle to spread it thinly over the pan base, making sure you cover the total surface area of the bottom of your pan. The idea is to get thin pancakes.</li><li>You will see the batter start to set in the pan, you can lift one side gently with a spatula to check if the underside is golden brown.  It normally takes a few minutes to get to this stage.  Try to resist messing around with your pancake too soon as this will cause it to stick.  An indication that the pancake is ready is that little air pockets will start to appear.</li><li>You can either flip your pancake with a spatula or toss it in the pan.  Cook on the other side for a few minutes until golden brown.  If you are like me, your first pancake may not be the best, but they will improve as you go along.</li><li>Slide your pancake out onto a clean plate, put some greaseproof paper on it and move on to the next one.  I tend to use some butter every two or three pancakes.  If you use it each time, it can get a little greasy, but try it out for yourself.</li><li>Carry on making pancakes, layering them up with paper until your batter is finished.</li><li>Method for making the Tomato Sauce</li><li>Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan on a medium high heat, add the shallots and garlic.  Allow them to cook for a couple of minutes, just to soften.</li><li>Add the tomatoes and stir through.  Cook on a gentle simmer for 7 minutes, add the basil (remember to keep some back for the top of your dish), stir through and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes.  Check for seasoning.</li><li>To assemble your Crespelle</li><li>Pre-heat your oven to 200C / 400F.</li><li>Smear your baking tin with butter.</li><li>Place the biggest of your pancakes in the tin.  Cover it with a layer of sauce, some pieces of mozzarella, ham and a sprinkle of parmesan.  Bear in mind that you will need to repeat this for as many pancakes as you have made.  Carry on until your cake tin is full and/or your mix is finished.  The top layer is sauce, cheeses and ham with a sprinkling of fresh basil leaves.</li><li>If your sauce and pancakes are still warm/hot, then baking will only take about 10 to 15 minutes in the oven.</li><li>If your ingredients are cold, then you can cover the tin with some aluminium foil, bake for about 10 minutes and then a further 10 minutes with the foil removed to give a crispy, melting top.</li><li>Remove from the oven and allow to rest for a couple of minutes.  Release from your baking tin and serve in slices.</li><li>Tips and Variations Serve with a simple green salad.  You can serve hot or at room temperature. You can get creative with your tomato sauce, using different herbs and cheeses.  I love to incorporate some tallegio cheese.  You can also use bolognese sauce giving a more lasagne twist. You can make the pancakes in advance.  I like to make them a day or two before, they keep well in the fridge. Of course if you have your own recipe for making thin, plain pancakes you can use it in this recipe. These quantities give about 15 pancakes, but dont worry if you get a little more or less.
